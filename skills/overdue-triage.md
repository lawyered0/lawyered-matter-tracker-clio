# Overdue Triage: Big Sweep Cleanup

## Purpose

The matter tracker accumulates stale deadlines. When a settlement conference happens, a court deadline passes, or a limitation is resolved by filing, the tracker doesn't auto-update. It relies on the user running `update matter [name]` on that specific file. Over time, columns I, R, and S fill up with past dates that no longer reflect reality.

This skill does one thing well: **sweep every open matter for overdue items, figure out which ones were already dealt with, and clean them up in a single batched write.** Items that look unresolved get surfaced as a red-flag list with suggested next actions.

This is the "once in a while" big triage. Daily email triage belongs to `daily-triage`.

## Conventions

- **"the lawyer"** refers to the user.
- **"Client"** refers to the retained party.
- **"Overdue item"** = any dated entry in columns I, R, or S where the date is before today.

## Dependencies

- **Matter tracker spreadsheet**: `matter-tracker.xlsx`, located using the same CWD, parent, grandparent resolution as matter-tracker.
- **Gmail MCP tools**: `gmail_search_messages`, `gmail_read_thread`, `gmail_read_message`. If unavailable, fall back to folder-scan only and warn the user.
- **Local file tools**: Glob, Grep, Read for folder scans.
- **calendar-sync skill**: After the batched tracker write, invoke `calendar-sync.reconcile(row)` for every matter touched, so resolved deadlines disappear from Key Dates.

## Detection Logic

Mirror `matter_to_dict()` in `app.py`. The three overdue sources are:

### 1. Column I (Next Action / Deadline): past-date Next Action

Parse column I with the regex `^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\s*:`. The date MUST be at the start of the string and followed by a colon. This matches the matter-tracker schema convention (`YYYY-MM-DD: [description]`). Do NOT use `\b(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\b` (searches anywhere in the string): that produces false positives when a historical or contextual date appears in prose (e.g., "adjourned from 2026-04-09", "assessment request form filed 2026-01-21"). If no leading date matches, the Next Action is open-ended and NOT overdue.

- Example overdue: `"2026-03-27: Settlement conference at 1:15 PM"` (leading date, past)
- Example NOT overdue: `"Awaiting client instructions re: oath"` (no leading date)
- Example NOT overdue: `"2026-05-15: Serve disclosure"` (leading date, future)
- Example NOT overdue: `"Settlement conference to be rescheduled (adjourned from 2026-04-09); awaiting new date"` (date is embedded, not leading, so no deadline)
- Example NOT overdue: `"Awaiting court to schedule assessment hearing (assessment request form filed 2026-01-21)"` (embedded filing date, not a deadline)

**Known inherited bug**: the `app.py` Flask dashboard uses the looser regex and will show the above embedded-date examples as overdue. The tracker data is fine; only the dashboard display is wrong. Consider patching `app.py` to match this skill's stricter regex.

### 2. Column R (Limitation Deadline): past limitation expiry

If column R is a date before today, the limitation has expired. This is the highest-stakes category. Never auto-clear without positive evidence the claim was filed or the user affirmatively tells you to. An expired limitation that wasn't filed is a potential malpractice issue; surface it loudly.

### 3. Column S (Court Deadlines): past entries in the JSON array

Parse column S as JSON. For each entry `{"date": "...", "description": "...", "source": "..."}`, if `date` is before today, that deadline is overdue. Entries can be independently resolved. Remove individual expired entries, not the whole array.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Tracker and Detect

1. Locate and load `matter-tracker.xlsx` (CWD, parent, grandparent, then ask).
2. Check for lock file `~$matter-tracker.xlsx`. If present, stop and tell the user to close Excel.
3. Read **"Open Matters"** only (closed matters are archived; don't touch them).
4. **Data quality pre-scan.** Before building the overdue list, sweep every open row for column-level data problems. Don't fail the scan. Collect warnings and surface them at the top of the final output. Checks:
   - Column G (Last Activity) non-empty but not a valid `YYYY-MM-DD` date (e.g., prose text written into the wrong cell).
   - Column I (Next Action) contains an embedded date but no leading date (often a sign the user meant to set a deadline and put it in the middle of the sentence).
   - Column R (Limitation Deadline) populated but column Q (Limitation Statute) is blank, or vice versa.
   - Column S (Court Deadlines) is not valid JSON (parse error).
5. For each matter row, extract:
   - File # (A), Client Name (B), Matter Description (C), Last Activity (G), Opposing Party (H), Next Action (I), Limitation Deadline (R), Court Deadlines (S), Other Parties (U), Matter Folder (T)
6. Build the overdue list. Each entry has:
   - `file_no`, `client`, `description`, `last_activity`, `matter_folder`
   - `overdue_type`: one of `"next_action"`, `"limitation"`, `"court_deadline"`
   - `overdue_date`: the past date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `overdue_text`: the description (e.g., "Settlement conference at 1:15 PM", "Amend claim to add corporation")
   - For court deadlines: `index` within the JSON array (needed to remove the specific entry)
7. **Cross-reference same-date events (col I + col S).** After building the raw list, look for duplicates: if a matter has a Next Action with leading date D AND a Court Deadline with date D (within 1 day tolerance, same description keywords), group them as a single "event" with both tracker touchpoints. When the lawyer confirms resolution on a grouped event, the write touches both columns in the batch (remove the col S entry AND replace the col I Next Action). This avoids asking the same question twice for what's really one hearing.
8. Sort the overdue list by `file_no`, then by `overdue_date` ascending. Grouped events sort by their shared date.
9. **Report the scan result before investigating:**

   ```
   Overdue scan: N items (G grouped events) across M matters.
     Court deadlines past date:  X
     Next Action dates past:     Y
     Limitation deadlines past:  Z (HIGH RISK, review carefully)
     Grouped (col I + col S same date): G

   Data quality warnings (K):
     * File #XXXX-XXX: Last Activity column contains prose, not a date
     * File #XXXX-XXX: Next Action has embedded date but no leading deadline
     ...

   Starting investigation. Gmail + folder scan per matter, then I'll walk you through each one for confirmation.
   ```

### Step 2: Per-Matter Investigation (chunked)

Group the overdue list by `file_no` (all overdue items on the same matter share the same investigation pull).

**Chunking.** Process matters in batches of **8** (configurable). Do not attempt all 30+ matters in one continuous pull. Gmail thread reads add up fast, and a 20+ minute silent stretch with no feedback is a poor UX. After each batch, emit a progress line:

```
Investigated 8/38 matters (3 with resolved evidence, 2 unresolved, 3 ambiguous). Continuing...
```

After every batch, offer an implicit bail-out: if the lawyer interrupts, the decisions made so far are preserved. Store in-progress evidence in a working JSON at `/tmp/overdue-triage-session.json` (or the OS-appropriate temp dir) keyed by `file_no`. On resume, skip matters already investigated this session.

For each matter in a batch:

1. **Gmail pull**: `gmail_search_messages` for the client name (from column B: strip the parenthetical principal name and search both the entity and the principal). Use `newer_than` based on the earliest overdue date for that matter, minus 7 days for context. Read every thread in full with `gmail_read_thread`. Snippets lie.
2. **Folder scan** (if column T is populated): `Glob` the matter folder for common legal file types (`**/*.pdf`, `**/*.docx`, `**/*.msg`, `**/*.eml`). Filter to files modified after the earliest overdue date minus 7 days.
3. **Read** the relevant files. For **scanned PDFs** where text extraction returns empty (common for court endorsements, affidavits of service, filed originals produced by the court or a process server): treat the **filename** and **modification date** as primary evidence of occurrence (e.g., `"ENDORSEMENT RECORD - DJ SMITH - 27 MAR 2026.pdf"` on disk strongly implies the hearing produced an order). Do not silently skip scanned PDFs. Record their filenames in the evidence bundle so the lawyer sees them in the confirmation step. Defer outcome detail (what the endorsement says, what was decided) to Gmail, the matter brief (`_matter-brief.md`), or the lawyer's memory.
4. **Read `_matter-brief.md`** if present in the matter folder. The brief is a privileged current-state snapshot. Its "Open Items" and "Last Updated" sections are often decisive evidence of what was pending vs. resolved.
5. For each overdue item on this matter, build the evidence bundle:
   - **Resolved evidence**: events in Gmail / folder / brief that clearly indicate the deadline was met or the underlying task is complete. Examples:
     - Settlement conference date passed, and there's a follow-up email from opposing counsel referencing what was discussed at conference. Resolved (happened).
     - Court deadline "Serve defendants by 2026-04-10" and folder has "Affidavit of Service - 2026-04-08.pdf". Resolved.
     - Next Action "2026-03-19: 7-day cure period expires" and Gmail shows a settlement agreement signed 2026-03-18. Resolved (mooted by settlement).
     - Overdue limitation and an issued claim is in the folder (file starts with court file number or contains "Issued" or "Statement of Claim"). Likely resolved (claim was filed); flag for "claim filed" confirmation.
   - **Unresolved evidence**: no activity, no reference, or explicit signs the task wasn't done. Example: "Serve the required court form on defendants by 2026-04-10" with no affidavit of service, no email about service, and no acknowledgment from opposing counsel. Unresolved.
   - **Ambiguous**: unclear. Default to treating as unresolved (safer) and flag it for the lawyer to decide.

**Scaled limitation pattern.** If the scan produced ≥5 overdue limitations AND the investigation evidence for those matters shows a court file number or issued claim in Gmail/folder (meaning the claim was clearly filed), present them together in the confirmation step as a bulk batch: "Found N limitation deadlines that appear resolved (claim filed in all cases based on court file numbers in Gmail). Review and bulk-approve?" Still gate on the lawyer confirmation. Never auto-clear a limitation. But one confirmation for N items beats N confirmations.

### Step 3: Per-Item Confirmation (one at a time)

For each overdue item, present it to the lawyer and ask for a decision.

**Use AskUserQuestion.** Group up to 4 items per tool call where possible (e.g., all 4 overdue items on the same matter), since AskUserQuestion supports 1 to 4 questions per call. If items span different matters, it's still fine to group across matters. Never exceed 4 questions per call.

Per-item question template:

```
Question text: "[File #X] [Client], [overdue_type]: '[overdue_text]' (was [overdue_date], [N] days ago). Evidence: [one-line summary of what Gmail/folder show]. Resolve?"

Header: "File #X" (or a short client tag if file # is long)

Options:
  1. "Resolve: [new Next Action or 'remove deadline']", description: "[2-3 sentence evidence summary + what will be written]"
  2. "Keep pending (unresolved)", description: "No clear evidence of completion. Will go on the red-flag list with suggested next action."
  3. "Skip this one", description: "Don't update the tracker either way. I'll revisit manually."
```

**For limitation deadlines specifically** (overdue_type = "limitation"), use a different option set:

```
Options:
  1. "Claim filed, clear limitation", description: "Will remove discovery date, statute, and deadline columns (P/Q/R). Requires evidence the claim was filed (e.g., issued claim in folder, court file number in emails)."
  2. "Close the matter", description: "The claim wasn't filed and the limitation has now expired. Closing may be appropriate if no action is intended. Will not auto-close; I'll flag it for you to run 'close matter [name]' after review."
  3. "Keep pending (unresolved)", description: "Flag as a live issue. Highest-priority red flag."
  4. "Skip this one", description: "Don't touch it. Review manually."
```

**Never** auto-clear a limitation deadline without the lawyer confirming option 1. Never auto-close a matter from this skill. If the lawyer picks option 2 on a limitation, the matter goes to the red-flag list with "run close matter [name]" as the suggested action.

### Step 4: Collect Decisions

Track each item's outcome in an in-memory structure:

```python
decisions = [
    {"file_no": "2026-012", "type": "court_deadline", "index": 0, "action": "resolve",
     "timeline_entry": "Served the required court form on defendants", "date": "2026-04-08"},
    {"file_no": "2026-012", "type": "next_action", "action": "resolve",
     "new_next_action": "2026-05-15: Motion for summary judgment",
     "timeline_entry": "Settlement conference held; no settlement reached"},
    {"file_no": "2026-008", "type": "limitation", "action": "unresolved",
     "flag_reason": "Limitation expired 14 days ago; no claim filed. Potential malpractice exposure."},
    {"file_no": "2026-019", "type": "next_action", "action": "skip"},
    ...
]
```

### Step 5: Present Batch Summary Before Writing

Before making any write, show the lawyer exactly what's about to change:

```
Ready to batch-apply changes. Here's what I'll write:

RESOLVED (N items):
  * File #2026-012 (Chen): remove court deadline "Serve the required court form" (2026-04-10)
    Timeline += "2026-04-08: Served the required court form on defendants"
  * File #2026-012 (Chen): update Next Action to "2026-05-15: Motion for summary judgment"
    Timeline += "2026-03-27: Settlement conference held; no settlement reached"
  * File #2026-015 (Acme Corp): remove court deadline "Amend claim" (2026-03-25)
    Timeline += "2026-03-20: Amended claim served per endorsement"
  ...

SKIPPED (X items):
  * File #2026-019 (Smith): Next Action "2026-03-15: Send draft SPA", skipped for manual review

UNRESOLVED (Y items), will go on red-flag list, no tracker writes:
  * File #2026-008 (Chen): Limitation expired 2026-04-05 (14 days ago), HIGH RISK
  * File #2026-021 (Taylor): Next Action "2026-03-10: File defence", 40 days overdue
  ...

Apply? [Y/N]
```

**Wait for explicit "yes" / "apply" / "go" before writing.** If the lawyer wants to edit any decision, roll back to Step 3 for that item.

### Step 6: Batched Write

Once the lawyer confirms:

1. **Backup the tracker once** (single timestamped copy in `backups/` beside the tracker). Do not back up per-item. One backup for the whole batch.
2. **Check for lock file again** right before opening. If it appeared, abort and tell the lawyer.
3. Open the workbook once (`openpyxl.load_workbook`), apply all approved changes in memory, save once. Rationale: the batched write is atomic. Either every approved change lands or none do. Per-item writes would leave the tracker in an inconsistent state if one failed mid-batch.
4. For each approved decision:

   **`action: "resolve"` on `type: "court_deadline"`:**
   - Parse column S JSON, remove the entry at the given index, serialize back. If the array is now empty, write empty string (not `"[]"`).
   - Append to column J (Timeline): `YYYY-MM-DD: [timeline_entry]`, using the `date` from the decision (the actual event date, not today).
   - Update column G (Last Activity) to today if the timeline entry date is later than current Last Activity.

   **`action: "resolve"` on `type: "next_action"`:**
   - Write the new Next Action string (from `new_next_action`) to column I. If the user indicated there's no new next action, write the next procedural step in prose (e.g., "Awaiting client instructions re: next steps").
   - Append timeline entry.
   - Update Last Activity to today.

   **`action: "resolve"` on `type: "limitation"` with subtype "claim_filed":**
   - Clear columns P (Discovery Date), Q (Limitation Statute), R (Limitation Deadline). Set all to empty.
   - Append timeline entry: `YYYY-MM-DD: Claim filed; limitation period closed.` (use issuance date from evidence).
   - Update Last Activity.

   **`action: "unresolved"` or `"skip"`:** no tracker write for this item.

5. Save the workbook. **Verify the saved file opens cleanly** by re-loading with openpyxl and confirming expected row count and that all edits are visible. If verification fails, alert the lawyer and point to the most recent backup.
6. Apply the row-formatting rules from `matter-tracker` SKILL.md when writing cells (borders, font, wrap text on C/I/J/S/U only). Most updates touch columns I, J, G, P, Q, R, or S, which are all existing cells on existing rows, so formatting should already be correct. Double-check wrap_text is preserved on any column you touch in I, J, or S.

### Step 7: Calendar Sync

After the save, invoke `calendar-sync.reconcile(row)` for every matter that had at least one tracker write. This prunes events for removed court deadlines, updates events for changed Next Actions, and cancels the limitation event if a claim was filed. Report:

```
Calendar sync: N events removed, M updated.
```

If calendar-sync fails, log and continue. Don't roll back the tracker write.

### Step 8: Red-Flag Report

Surface unresolved items loudly. Format:

```
===============================================================
RED-FLAG LIST: Items still pending after triage
===============================================================

LIMITATION EXPIRED (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
  * File #2026-008: Chen, M.
    Matter: Constructive dismissal claim
    Limitation expired: 2026-04-05 (14 days ago)
    Last activity: 2026-03-01 (49 days ago)
    Statute: general_statute
    > Suggested action: URGENT. Confirm whether claim was filed. If not, assess malpractice exposure and notify insurer if applicable. Do NOT file out of time without a limitations statute discoverability analysis.

COURT DEADLINES PAST DATE:
  * File #2026-019: Smith, J.
    Deadline: "Serve the required court form on defendants", was 2026-04-10 (9 days ago)
    Last activity: 2026-03-15 (35 days ago)
    > Suggested action: Confirm service status. If not served, serve immediately and disclose late service to the court. If served, run "update matter Smith" to log the service date.

NEXT ACTION PAST DATE:
  * File #2026-021: Taylor, M.
    Next Action: "2026-03-10: File defence"
    Overdue by: 40 days
    Last activity: 2026-02-20 (58 days ago)
    > Suggested action: Confirm whether defence was filed. If not, check for default proceedings. If filed, update the tracker.

STALE BUT NOT OVERDUE:
  (none. This skill only reports overdue. Run 'show my open files' with a staleness filter to see non-overdue stale matters.)

===============================================================
```

**Suggested action writing rules:**
- Be specific. "Follow up" is not a suggestion. Name who to contact, what to check, and what the next procedural step is.
- For limitation expiries, always flag malpractice exposure analysis. Never minimize.
- For service deadlines, always mention the the applicable relief-from-consequences rule relief-from-consequences option if the deadline was missed.
- For court deadlines tied to endorsements, suggest checking the order text to see if the court attached consequences (e.g., "failure to serve results in dismissal").
- Match the lawyer's preference: no em dashes, no sugar-coating.

## Behaviour Rules

1. **One backup per batch, not per item.** The batched write is atomic.
2. **Never auto-clear limitation deadlines.** Always require the lawyer's explicit "Claim filed" confirmation.
3. **Never auto-close matters.** If a matter looks closeable, add it to the red-flag list with "run close matter [name]" as the suggested action.
4. **Always show the batch summary before writing.** No silent writes.
5. **Confirm one item at a time, up to 4 per AskUserQuestion call.** Group items on the same matter where possible to reduce round-trips, but per-item granularity is the user's explicit requirement.
6. **If Gmail is unavailable, proceed with folder-only investigation and warn the lawyer up front.** Evidence will be weaker; expect more "unresolved" outcomes.
7. **If the matter folder (column T) is blank**, skip the folder scan for that matter and rely on Gmail alone. Don't try to fuzzy-resolve the folder inside this skill. That belongs to matter-tracker.
8. **Ambiguous evidence defaults to "unresolved".** When in doubt, flag rather than auto-resolve. This is a cleanup skill, not an inference skill.
9. **Preserve timeline chronology.** New timeline entries go in chronological position when merged into column J. If the event date matches an existing entry, skip (don't duplicate).
10. **Report the full numbers at the end.** "Scanned N matters, N1 overdue items, N2 resolved, N3 flagged, N4 skipped."
11. **Stop and ask if scan detects zero overdue items.** Say "Tracker is clean, no overdue items. Nothing to do." Do not proceed to investigation.
12. **Court deadlines JSON index matters.** When removing an entry from column S, use the index from the parsed JSON array. Recompute indices if multiple entries on the same matter are being removed (remove highest index first, or reload the JSON between removals).
13. **Group same-date events across columns I and S.** A hearing listed in both columns (same date, overlapping description) is one event. Confirm once, write to both columns.
14. **Investigate in batches of 8 matters.** Emit a progress line between batches. Persist investigated evidence to `/tmp/overdue-triage-session.json` so an interrupted run can resume without re-pulling Gmail.
15. **Scanned PDFs count as evidence.** Filename + modification date on a court endorsement or affidavit-of-service PDF is sufficient to establish occurrence even when text extraction fails. Record the filename in the evidence bundle.
16. **Data-quality warnings go at the top of the output**, before the red-flag list. Non-date Last Activity values, invalid Court Deadlines JSON, and orphaned limitation statute/deadline pairs all belong here. This is a tracker-hygiene skill by side effect, so surface the problems rather than working around them silently.

## Suggested-Action Library

A concise reference for writing the red-flag list. Use these as templates. Customize to the specific facts.

| Scenario | Template suggested action |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Limitation expired, no claim filed | "URGENT: Limitation expired [N] days ago. Confirm non-filing. If confirmed, conduct a limitations-statute discovery analysis for any late-filing argument. Notify insurer if exposure exists. Consider the discoverability defence in the alternative." |
| Court deadline missed (service) | "Confirm service status. If not served, serve immediately. Assess whether the applicable relief-from-consequences rule relief from consequences is needed. Notify opposing counsel of late service and confirm no prejudice." |
| Court deadline missed (filing) | "Confirm filing status. If not filed, file now with an explanation letter to the court. Check for any default proceedings initiated by opposing counsel." |
| Court deadline missed (endorsement compliance) | "Check the endorsement text for automatic consequences. If the endorsement attached consequences (e.g., dismissal, striking of claim), assess the applicable civil procedure rule motion to set aside. Notify client immediately." |
| Next Action: settlement conference passed | "Log conference outcome (result, positions taken, next steps). If ordered to a further step, add to court deadlines. If settled, proceed to close." |
| Next Action: cure period expired | "Confirm whether breach was cured. If cured, note and proceed. If not, file for judgment per the agreement. Client decision needed." |
| Next Action: client instructions overdue | "Follow up with client directly (phone, not email). If no response after [7 days], send formal written follow-up. If still no response, consider terminating the retainer per the engagement letter." |
| Next Action: waiting on opposing counsel | "Follow up with opposing counsel by letter (not email). If no response in [7 days], proceed with the next procedural step unilaterally." |
| Generic missed deadline | "Confirm current status via client/file review. Update Next Action to reflect actual state. If the deadline created a cascade (e.g., defence due triggers disclosure), recalculate downstream dates." |

## Output Checklist (at end of run)

Every overdue-triage run ends with a final message that includes:

1. Scan summary (N matters scanned, K overdue items found).
2. Batch write result (N1 resolved, backup path).
3. Calendar sync diff (N events removed, M updated).
4. Red-flag list in full (every unresolved item with suggested action).
5. Any errors or warnings (Gmail unavailable, folder not found, etc.).
6. One-line closer: "Overdue triage complete. Next recommended run: in ~3-4 weeks."
